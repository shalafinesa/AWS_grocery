# Deployment Guide for EC2 with S3 Integration

## 1. Pull New Code Changes from GitHub

### Step 1.1: Fetch and Pull the Latest Code
1. In your project root directory:
2. Fetch and pull the latest code from the branch `version1`

    ```bash
    git fetch origin
    git pull origin version1
    ```

3. Do it both in the local machine and in the EC2 machine.

## 2. Configure Permissions and CORS for S3

### Step 2.1: Create the structure of the s3
1. Create an avatars folder in your s3
2. Add a user_default.png of your liking, make sure you have one file call user_default.png

### Step 2.2: Set Up S3 Bucket Permissions
1. Go to the AWS S3 Console.
2. Select the bucket you’re using (e.g., `grocery-s3`).
3. Navigate to the **Permissions** tab.
4. In the **Bucket Policy** section, add a policy to allow public GET and PUT requests for your bucket (update the ARN to match your bucket's):

    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": "*",
                "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject"],
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::grocery-s3/avatars/*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
   
This policy gives public access to `GET` and `PUT` operations in the `avatars` folder. This setup allows users to retrieve and upload images without needing extra permissions.

### Step 2.3: Set Up CORS for the S3 Bucket
1. In the same **S3 Permissions** tab, navigate to Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).
2. Add the following CORS configuration:

    ```json
    [
        {
            "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
            "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "POST", "PUT"],
            "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
            "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
            "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
        }
    ]
    ```

3. Save changes.

The CORS configuration allows access to the bucket from various sources. Here, `AllowedOrigins` is set to `*`, meaning it allows all domains. This is essential when accessing S3 resources from a web browser, as it prevents cross-origin issues.

## 3. Update Environment Variables (.env)

### Step 3.1: Set Up SSO for AWS Credentials
1. Use AWS SSO to get temporary access credentials to obtain temporary access credentials for local development only.
2. Update your backend `.env` file with these credentials:

    ```plaintext
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
    AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=your_session_token
    S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
    S3_REGION=eu-central-1
    USE_S3_STORAGE=true
    ```
   
3. Update your frontend `.env` file with these credentials:

   ```plaintext
    REACT_APP_USE_S3_STORAGE=true
   REACT_APP_S3_BUCKET=grocery-s3
   REACT_APP_S3_REGION=eu-central-1
    ```

4. Be sure to create a new build folder after these changes to get the changes in your env file

### Step 3.2: Test Changes Locally
1. Activate the virtual environment for your backend.

    ```bash
    source backend/venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. Run the backend locally to ensure there are no issues with your setup.
3. Test frontend locally by generating a new build.
4. Try to add an avatar now to the user and see if is correctly saved in the DB with your S3 route

Testing changes locally helps catch any errors in your setup before deploying. By adding an avatar, you ensure the backend, S3 integration, and database are all correctly configured.
Also, you will learn about what happens behind when you use a IAM role in EC2, this is what the role will do automatic without you need to add manually the env file keys of SSO.

## 4. Setting Up an IAM Role for EC2 with S3 Access

### Step 4.1: Create the IAM Role
1. Go to the **IAM Console** in AWS.
2. In the left sidebar, select **Roles** and then click on **Create role**.
3. In the **Select trusted entity** section:
   - Choose **AWS service**.
   - Select **EC2** as the service that will use this role.
   - Click **Next** to move to permissions.

4. **Attach Policies**:
   - Search for and select the policy **AmazonS3FullAccess**. This policy allows full access to all S3 actions.

5. **Review and Create**:
   - Review the role settings.
   - Name the role (e.g., `grocery-ec2-role`).
   - Click **Create role**.

This IAM role is now set up with S3 access permissions.

### Step 4.2: Attach the IAM Role to Your EC2 Instance
1. Go to the **EC2 Console** in AWS.
2. In the left sidebar, select **Instances** and find the EC2 instance you want to attach the role to.
3. Select your instance, then choose **Actions** > **Security** > **Modify IAM role**.
4. In the **IAM role** dropdown, select the newly created IAM role (`grocery-ec2-role`).
5. Click **Update IAM role**.

Now, your EC2 instance has the IAM role attached with permissions to interact with S3.

### Step 4.3: Verify Role Permissions on EC2
1. **SSH into your EC2 instance**.

    ```bash
    ssh -i "your_key.pem" ec2-user@<your-ec2-ip>
    ```

2. **Check Role Permissions**:
   Use the following command to verify that the EC2 instance has access to the IAM role and S3:

    ```bash
    curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/grocery-ec2-role
    ```

   This command should return JSON with temporary security credentials, confirming that the role is correctly attached.

With this setup, your EC2 instance should automatically use the IAM role’s permissions for S3 access, removing the need to use static credentials in `.env` files for EC2 deployment.

## 5. Deploy to EC2

### Step 5.1: Stop the Running App on EC2
1. SSH into your EC2 instance:

    ```bash
    ssh -i "your_key.pem" ec2-user@<your-ec2-ip>
    ```

2. Stop any running instances of your app.

    ```bash
    pkill -f 'python run.py'
    ```

### Step 5.2: Remove the Existing Build Folder (if needed)
- Ensure the previous build folder is removed.

    ```bash
    rm -rf ~/AWS_grocery/frontend/build
    ```

### Step 5.3: Upload the New Build to EC2
1. From your local machine, upload the **updated** build folder to EC2:

    ```bash
    scp -i your_key.pem -r /path/to/local/build ec2-user@<your-ec2-ip>:~/AWS_grocery/frontend/build
    ```

### Step 5.4: Start the App with New Code
1. SSH back into the EC2 instance if you aren’t already.
2. Activate the virtual environment and start the backend:

    ```bash
    source ~/AWS_grocery/backend/venv/bin/activate && cd ~/AWS_grocery/backend && nohup python run.py > ~/AWS_grocery/backend/app.log 2>&1 &
    ```

### Verify the App is Running
- Check logs for errors:

    ```bash
    tail -f ~/AWS_grocery/backend/app.log
    ```

- Access the app through the load balancer in your browser and test if avatars are working in deployment too.

## ⚠️ Important Note for Local and EC2 Environments

- ⚠️ **Local Development**: Use the following environment variables in your `.env` file only for local development to authenticate with AWS using SSO or your IAM user credentials.

    ```plaintext
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
    AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=your_session_token
    ```

- ⚠️ **EC2 Deployment**: When deploying to EC2, **do not include these credentials** in the `.env` file. The EC2 instance will automatically assume the `grocery-ec2-role` IAM role, so these variables are unnecessary and could cause conflicts. 

## Things to remember

- **Rebuild Locally**: Create a new build locally once you confirm that everything works. This ensures your frontend reflects any recent changes, later send it to the EC2 machine using scp.
- **S3 Permissions**: Double-check that S3 permissions and CORS settings allow public access to avatar files.
- **Environment Variables**: Make sure the `.env` files on EC2 are updated with the latest configuration for proper S3 access, without adding the credentials in the backend `.env`.
- **SSO keys are temporal and will change**: Make sure the `.env` files on your local are updated with the latest SSO credentials in your env file, for the EC2 the IAM role will auto refresh those.
